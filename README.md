# Draft
This full-stack application enables mutliple users to start and join drafts simultaneously. Drafts are created with the information of who is playing, the number of rounds, and the possible picks. The person who creates the draft gets a unique draft ID which they can share to the other members of the draft. The draft has live updates to showcase each player in the draft what picks have been made by who and whose turn to pick it currently is. The application has lots of error handling to ensure that only valid drafts are created and valid users join the draft.
